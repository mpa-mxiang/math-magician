import React from 'react';

const Home = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Welcome to our page</h1>
    <p>
      This is my first React SPA project,
      if you click &quot;calculator&quot; on the header,
      then you will see a calculator similar to Apple&apos;s design.
      And you can see a random quote about computer if you click &quot;quote&quot;.
    </p>
  </div>
);

export default Home;
